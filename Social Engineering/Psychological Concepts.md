**Influence** - driving a person's behavior to cause a particular outcome
**Manipulation** - detrimental implementation of influence, typically meant to cause harm
**Rapport** - mutual trust. To build rapport with targets, SEs often rely on shared experiences (whether real or bluffed), play to the target’s interests, and emphasize their own personality traits.

Six Principles

**Authority** - People tend to perform a certain action when someone in a position of authority tells them to do so or when led to believe (truthfully or with false pretense) that an authority figure is also doing that action
**Likability** - People tend to want to help likable people.
**Urgency and Scarcity** - People want things of which there are few
**Commitment and Consistency** - People don't like change
**Social Proof** - In a social engineering campaign, the attacker could rely on social proof by taking time to collect some OSINT. They might identify who in the company is influential. Then they’d send you an email, claiming that they spoke to the influential person, who sung your praises and provided your contact information to help them solve the “problem.”
**Reciprocity** - We all try to help people who ask for it
**Sympathy and empathy** - An excellent way to build rapport, _sympathy_ is caring that a person feels bad or is under some form of duress, like after losing a loved one or pet. Sometimes confused with sympathy, _empathy_ is understanding how people feel as if you were in their situation. Empathy uses shared emotions or shared perspectives, whereas sympathy expresses only how _you_ feel.
