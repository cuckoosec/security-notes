**Pretexting** - the act of impersonating someone
* You could pretext with a uniform, an invented backstory, or the _context for the contact_, a term I use to refer to your excuse for talking to your victim. If you claimed to work with the dumpster management company while holding a clipboard and wearing the company’s uniform, for example, you’d be pretexting.

**Phishing** is the act of sending fraudulent emails to influence or coerce a target into providing information, opening files, or clicking links

**Spear phishing** is a variation of conventional phishing in which the social engineer focuses on a specific target.
* If you were a fisherman using a spear rather than a net, you’d probably need to know how each species of fish behaved and how to approach them. Similarly, as a social engineer, you’ll need to collect, synthesize, and weaponize OSINT about your target company or person to properly snare them.

**Whaling** is phishing for the “big phish”—generally, a company’s senior executives. 
* Imagine that your target is the CFO of a company. You might try to make some modifications to the fake human resources spear-phishing email you sent earlier to build additional rapport with the target. You could personalize the name on the email, add their position, or mention other key features about the target company’s implementation of the platform that only they should know.

In a **vishing** attack, an attacker calls a target and speaks to them over the phone. 
* Vishing is often harder than phishing, because it requires improvisation skills. While phishing affords you the time to think about what you’d like to say before you send your email, vishing entails having your story put together from the beginning and rapidly recalling abstract details of it.

**Baiting** is using some sort of bait to get the target to perform an action.
* To understand the efficiency of QR codes, consider their prevalence in 2020 as restaurants began using them to allow “touch-free” menus.
