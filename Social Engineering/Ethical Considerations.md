Let’s start by talking about the social engineering attack itself. In a social engineering engagement, you must be sensitive to how a target will feel as a result of your actions. This can be tricky, because you have to develop ways of showing that a company is vulnerable, usually because the employees lack proper training or processes to follow, without victimizing or villainizing the person who revealed those vulnerabilities to you.

Next, I called a public works number. A nice lady in her 60s answered. We exchanged pleasantries, and I explained the survey. She agreed to help as much as she could but told me she wasn’t very tech savvy.

“Me either,” I said. “I’m doing this work part-time while I go to the ACME Community College for psychology.” We shared a laugh, and I began the survey.
